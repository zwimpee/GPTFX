# GPTFX (GPT-Extended)

GPTFX is a framework that wraps an LLM (Large Language Model) agent into a TFX (Tensorflow Extended) pipeline, leveraging the capabilities of Tensorflow Extended for efficient machine learning operations. It enables the seamless integration of an LLM agent within the TFX pipeline architecture, allowing for enhanced automation and task completion using prompt engineering techniques.

The primary goal of GPTFX is to provide a scalable and extensible framework for incorporating an LLM agent into TFX pipelines. It enables the generation of container-based TFX components that house the LLM agent, along with other custom components such as configuration generators and output data processors. By combining the power of LLM models with the robustness of TFX, GPTFX facilitates the development of sophisticated language-driven machine learning pipelines.

## Technologies Used

GPTFX utilizes a range of technologies and frameworks, including:

- **Python 3.8 and 3.10**: The primary language for development, offering flexibility and a rich ecosystem of libraries.
- **Docker**: The containerization platform for building and deploying container images, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution environments.
- **Apache Beam**: A unified programming model for defining and executing data processing pipelines, enabling distributed processing and scalability.
- **Kubernetes**: An orchestration platform for managing containerized applications, providing scalability, resilience, and simplified deployment on various cloud platforms.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: A scalable and managed database service (specific provider not yet determined) for storing project-related data.
- **Cloud Service Provider**: A cloud platform for deployment (specific provider not yet determined), offering infrastructure and services for scalable and reliable application hosting.
- **OpenAI API**: Integration with the OpenAI language models via the Python library, unlocking powerful natural language processing capabilities.
- **Tensorflow and TFX**: Core frameworks for building and running machine learning pipelines, offering data processing, model training, and model serving capabilities.

## Current Progress

Currently, the project is in the proof of concept stage. The development efforts involve forking the Auto-GPT repository and extending it into the GPTFX project. The focus is on creating container-based TFX components, a configuration generator component, and an output data processor component. These components will seamlessly integrate the LLM agent into the TFX pipeline, enabling the generation of a prompt for the agent, the execution of the agent pipeline, and the processing of the agent’s output.

# Challenges and Next Steps
The GPTFX project faces several challenges and has identified the following next steps:

- **Containerizing TFX Components**: One of the primary challenges is properly containerizing the TFX components and ensuring compatibility with the pipeline. This includes managing dependencies, optimizing resource utilization, and addressing potential deployment issues.

- **Integrating the LLM Agent**: Another challenge is effectively integrating the LLM agent into the container-based components. This involves designing the architecture to leverage the agent's capabilities, implementing efficient communication, and ensuring seamless interaction with other components.

- **Enhancing Custom Components**: The custom components, such as the configuration generator and output data processor, need further enhancements. This includes adding advanced configuration options, incorporating data pre-processing and post-processing functionalities, and optimizing their performance.

- **Exploring Cloud Service Providers**: The project is in the process of evaluating different cloud service providers for deployment. The next step involves conducting a thorough analysis to select the most suitable provider that aligns with the project's requirements in terms of scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the overall performance and scalability of the TFX pipeline is an ongoing priority. This includes benchmarking, identifying bottlenecks, and fine-tuning the pipeline components to ensure efficient resource utilization and high throughput.
